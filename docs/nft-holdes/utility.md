# Utility roadmap
Since now I have NFT project on fxhash, I decided to add utility to my drop holders.

I plan to add features gradually so that you can try them early and leave feedback.

### Mempool gas tracker
Allow you to see what gas was placed by other wallets. So you can decide what gas to set to win the race.

### Mint hisotory
Shows who minted, by what price, and what gas was setted. Useful to analyze the behavior of collector on previous drops. Shows failed transactions and gas spent on them. Sorting by date, price and gas.

### Drop stats
Statistics and a chart that shows how many people at what price collected a drop. How many unique wallets does the drop hold. Time to soldout on public sale.

### Following list for collectors
See who minted NFT in statistics tab. Notifications when following collects/mints item.

### Mint by one click
Add address by private key directly on website without temple wallet, kukai, etc. It allows to mint fast without confirm button. Data stored only on your browser. Add multiple accounts, change accounts by hot keys.

### Sniper
If you add account by private key you can config sniper to buy first from paper hands for low price.
